# 🌍 Deployment Details
The application is **not deployed** due to API limitations (see below).  
Local development uses:

- **Frontend:** `Vite` → `http://localhost:5173`
- **Backend:** `Flask` → `http://localhost:5000`

# ❗ Unavailability of Working Demo Link

While our project harnesses the incredible power of the Groq API for cutting-edge LLM-driven transaction classification and financial insights, we're currently operating on a free-tier account. This means daily API queries are limited, and as these credentials are linked to an individual team member, public sharing or full deployment isn't possible just yet. This API dependency is a temporary hurdle for continuous model operation, large-scale testing, and public hosting.
